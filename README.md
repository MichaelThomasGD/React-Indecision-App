# React-Indecision-App
Through the study of React, I have developed a "to-do list" style application that consists of a few simple features. This project is to display the use of different languages and skills needed to create a simple React application.

## Installation
1. Download the zip file, extract it into a desired directory and open the folder into a chosen code editor.
2. Once the folder is one in a code editor, run a terminal with the directory of the root file "indecision app".
3. From there type the following command to create the necessary node modules. "npm add react"
4. Once the node modules are created, the application can be ran by running the following command: "npm run dev-server".

## Languages/ Features
1. HTML - Structure
2. SCSS - Styling  
3. React - Core/ Functionality
4. Babel - JS Compiler
5. NPM - Library Installer
6. Webpack - Module Bundler
